# Diamond Tofu Career

## Introduction

Building a career site with a RESTful architecture involves breaking down the application into smaller, modular components that can communicate with each other through APIs. 

## Steps
Define the requirements: Determine what features the site will need, such as the ability to search for jobs, apply for jobs, and manage job applications. Consider the needs of both job seekers and administrators.    

Design the database schema: Decide on the data models you will need to store job listings, job applications, and user information. Plan how the different data models will be related to each other.    

Choose a backend framework: Select a backend framework that is well-suited for RESTful architecture, such as Express.js, Flask, or Django. Create RESTful endpoints for accessing and manipulating data in the database.    

Develop the frontend: Use a frontend framework such as React to create the user interface for the career site. The frontend should consume the RESTful endpoints to display job listings, allow job seekers to submit applications, and allow administrators to manage job applications.    

Deploy on Firebase: Deploy the application on Google Cloud Platform Firebase. Firebase provides a real-time database that can be used to store data and allows for easy scalability.    

Implement CRUD operations: Implement the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the real-time database. This will allow users to create and manage job listings, job applications, and user information.   

Test and debug: Test the application thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. Debug any issues that arise during testing.    

Implement UX/UI design: Once the technical requirements are satisfied, implement a user experience/user interface design that meets the business requirements. This involves considering how users interact with the site and making design choices that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional.    

Launch: Once the application is thoroughly tested, deploy it to a production environment and launch it to the public.
